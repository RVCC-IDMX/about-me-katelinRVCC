    <h1>HELLO WORLD!!</h1>

    <p>This is my first website! It's nice to be learning how to do this but it is exrtremely challenging for me. I am terrible with computers and none of this makes any sense! The video provided on how to do this was informational and made it a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>I assume that as the course progresses it will be much more difficult. This is what I'm worried for, but no sense worrying! I got this and I'll figure it out and learn something along the way! I'm not sure what else to type, the video instructed us to write whatever we wanted so I thought that just writing me first thoughts would sufice!</p>
